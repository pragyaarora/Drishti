# Drishti
Drishti is an Amazon Echo app, which when triggered with voice commands, reads out text from images. The text recognition part was done using Googleâ€™s Vision APIs. Amazon AWS Lambda was used to host the backend using a serverless architecture and an Alexa SkillSet was developed for interfacing the voice commands for Echo device.
